                <br>
                <br> Website <a href="gallery.html">www.academart.com</a> has been created in 1999 in order to represent major lines of the activity of <a href="http://academart.com/history.htm">The "Academy of Arts" Foundation</a>. Broad audience including personnel of museums and private galleries, collectors and connoisseurs of visual art can find here comprehensive information regarding artists and the events taking place on the scene of figurative visual art in Saint Petersburg.
                <br>
                <br>
                <br> The website <a href="gallery.html">www.academart.com</a> demonstrates the works which are at artists' studios. We update information monthly both on personal pages of artists and in the content of the website.
                <br>
                <br> The "Academy of Arts" Foundation represents creative works by artists-graduates, lecturers and gifted students of I. E. Repin Institute of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture (Saint-Petersburg). The Foundation involves in its projects the outstanding artists, whose works represent the best of Saint Petersburg professional figurative art.
                <br>
                <br> Each of our artists is, certainly, an exclusive creative personality. However, they all rest upon high professional skills obtained due to education at the Repin's Institute of Russian Academy of Arts.
                <br>
                <br> The I. E. Repin Institute of Russian Academy of Arts (former Russian Emperor's Academy of Arts) has been founded in the middle of XVIII following All-European trend in visual art. Since that time, Russian Academic educational process is guided by the traditions inherited from famous European artists of XVI-XVII and from eminent Russian artists of XVIII-XX. Thus, graduates of the Repin's Institute come away with sophisticated fine art culture, which is not only distinguished by their professional colleagues but also grabs attention of viewers and fine arts amateurs.
                <br>
                <br> The "Academy of Arts" Foundation cooperates with several generations of artists. Creative works by <a href="http://academart.com/eremeev_oil_paintings.php">Oleg Yeremeev</a>, <a href="http://academart.com/repin_oil_paintings.php">Nikolay Repin</a>, <a href="http://academart.com/davidenkova_visual_art_gallery.php">L. Davydenkova</a>, <a href="http://academart.com/razdrogin_oil_paintings.php">E. Razdrogin</a> - senior professors of the I.E. Repin Institute - follow traditions of Russian soviet realistic school. These traditions are revitalizing in the art of professors <a href="http://academart.com/kichko.php">S. Kichko</a> and <a href="http://academart.com/Fomin.php">N. Fomin</a>. These traditions also influence the artists graduated from the Repin Institute in the second half of XX century: <a href="http://academart.com/Savelieva_soviet_period_art.php">V. Savelyeva</a>,<a href="http://academart.com/suvorov_soviet_realism_paintings.php"> I. Suvorov</a>,<a href="http://academart.com/natchev_landscape_oil_paintings.php"> A. Natchev</a>,<a href="http://academart.com/khorosheva_romantic_oil_paintings.php"> O. Khorosheva</a>, <a href="http://academart.com/olga_nedzvetskaya.php">O. Nedzvetzkaya</a>.
                <br>
                <br> Opposite to named above artists are those who participated in liberalization of Saint Petersburg art life in the last quarter of XX century - <a href="http://academart.com/yakhnin_professional_graphic.php">O. Yakhnin</a>,<a href="http://academart.com/dominov.php"> R. Dominov</a>,<a href="http://academart.com/sazhin.php"> N. Sazhin</a>, <a href="http://academart.com/Fedorova_figurative_art.php">T. Fedorova</a>. Their artworks included in the collections of major Russian museums.
                <br>
                <br> Several exhibition projects organized by The Foundation successfully represented a new generation of artists emerged at the end of 1990-es, when freedom of spirit and pluralism have eventually rooted in Russian art. Freedom stimulated many artists - <a href="http://academart.com/dozortzev.php">O. Dozortzev</a>, <a href="http://academart.com/suvorova.php">O. Suvorova</a>,<a href="http://academart.com/expositions.htm"> M. Mikhailovsky</a> (1968-2002),<a href="http://academart.com/kurbanov.php"> A. Kurbanov</a>,<a href="http://academart.com/bekhova_imaginary_paintings.php">J. Bekhova</a>, <a href="http://academart.com/blokhin.php">N. Blokhin</a>, <a href="http://academart.com/sklyarenko.php">A. Sklyarenko</a>,<a href="http://academart.com/smukrovich.php"> V. Smukrovich</a> - to find original and powerful author's concepts within extraordinarily diverse stylistic range. The last decade showed capability of these artists to develop permanently. These days many of them became lecturers at the Repin's Institute.
                <br>
                <br> The artworks by recently emerged artists - <a href="http://academart.com/ichitovkin.php">Denis Ichitovkin</a> and <a href="http://academart.com/nedzvetskaya.php">Alexandra Nedzvetskaya</a> - progressively become unconditionally original and more substantial. Their works have been presented on multiple exhibitions where they draw attention and caused considerable interest of viewers and connoisseurs of visual art.
                <br>
                <br> Long term cooperation with the artists graduates of the Academy of Arts allows Foundation's personnel to observe development of creative individuality of our authors, to survey emergence of extraordinary artworks. Regular update at <a href="gallery.html">www.academart.com</a> provides broad audience with the precious opportunity to watch this exciting creative process.
                <br>
